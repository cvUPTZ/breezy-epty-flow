# Chrome Extension Summary

## Purpose

The Chrome extension is designed to track football match events directly within the YouTube interface. It enhances the viewing experience by allowing users to log in and record significant match events (e.g., goals, cards, substitutions) while watching live streams or VODs.

## Integration with YouTube

The extension injects a dedicated interface onto YouTube watch pages. This provides a user-friendly way to input and view match events without leaving the YouTube player.

## Key Features

*   **User Authentication:** Enables users to log in, likely to save their event data and participate in collaborative event logging.
*   **Event Recording:** Users can record various types of football match events as they happen.
*   **Real-time Collaboration & Notifications:** The extension uses Supabase as a backend to store event data. This allows multiple users watching the same match to see events recorded by others in real-time and potentially receive notifications for new events.
